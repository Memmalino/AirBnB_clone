This is our Group AirBnB_clone project

Description of  the Project:
This repository contains the first part(Part 1) of a student project to build a clone of the AirBnB website. The backend interface is handled using the Object Oriented Programming concept in python, while the front end is being handled using the python's CMD module this servers as a command line interpreter and allows the user to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage. Using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between sessions.

Unittest was used to handle  the testing part of this project.
